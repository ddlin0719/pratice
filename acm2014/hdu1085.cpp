/*
The floor has 200 rooms each on the north side and south side
 along the corridor. Recently the Company made a plan to reform 
 its system. The reform includes moving a lot of tables between 
 rooms. Because the corridor is narrow and all the tables are big
 , only one table can pass through the corridor.
